<h1 align="center">Descriptions</h1>

Cookie Clicker is an addictive online game where the player has to click on a cookie to collect points. The aim of the game is to collect as many cookies as possible by clicking on the main cookie and using the points accumulated to buy upgrades and bonuses that increase cookie production. The more the player clicks on the cookie, the more points they earn, and the more upgrades they can buy to increase their cookie production. The game is simple but highly addictive, as it encourages players to keep clicking to get more and more cookies.
